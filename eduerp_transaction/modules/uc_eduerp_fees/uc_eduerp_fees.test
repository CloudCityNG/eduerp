* Creating the structure (just creating a class that inherits from DrupalWebTestCase)
* Initializing the test case with whatever user creation or configuration needs to be done
* Creating actual tests within the test case
* And, of course, trying desperately to figure out why our test doesn't work the way we expect, and debugging the test (and perhaps the module)
